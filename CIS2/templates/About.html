    To inculcate human values, ethics, patriotism and responsibility in our outgoing engineers by providing conducive environment.</p>


<h2>Program Educational Objectives (PEOs)</h2>
<p>To understand the applications of science and humanities ,basic introductory engineering courses , core subjects of the curriculum of the course and interdisciplinary subjects, a specialized group subjects, electives, projects ,seminars, group discussion supplemented by site visits and local short tours.
To make students familiar with modern equipments, instruments ,instrumentations , software and other computational, mathematical, design and project management tools.
They should be capable themselves to handle complex problems based on their acquired knowledgeable with other available sources of information and references.
They should be able to carry out research, design, consultancy services innovations and patents to the existing situations independently for the betterment of society.
To use up-to-date techniques and skills required in modern era to analyze problems in industrial field.
They should be competent to model real life problems using software and hardware platforms both in offline and in real time mode.
They should do analysis independently of real life problems of design and use computing systems appropriate to their solutions that are technically sound, economically feasible, viable and sustainable.
To make the students conversant with the methods and the instruments being presently used in field thus bridging the gaps between the curriculum and industry requirements.
To churn out the aspirants of engineering courses into first class engineers and assist them in placements during the course of the study.
To develop the department by conducting faculty development programs and also encouraging their participation in conferences, seminars,workshops and guest lectures at national level and international level.
To develop the skills of the staff by conducting staff development programs and encourage participate in them.
